# Geospatial Data Processing
A comprehensive repository that contains all necessary information/instructions/code for preprocessing orthophotos based on geospatial queries, including stitching, resizing, and performance optimization.

## Project Structure

- `notebooks/` - contains analysis or attempts to walkthrough how I solved some issues.
- `main.py` - entry point of the repository.
- `utils.py` - used in `main.py` as well as in notebooks.
- `pyproject.toml` - lists the packages to install (similar to `requirements.txt`).

## General Information
- Official start date: 10.01.2024 (14:00 CET)
- Real start date: 11.01.2024
- Deadline: 14.01.2024 (14:00 CET, when I received an email)

## Prerequisites

- [X] Proficiency in Python programming.
- [X] Knowledge of Geospatial data handling, GIS, and Coordinate Reference Systems (CRS).
- [X] Experience with image processing libraries in Python, such as PIL or OpenCV.

## Task

### TODO List
- [X] Read the task definition carefully (2 times or more to verify that this is exactly what the company asks!) and write the task definition for yourself.
    - [X] Verify that you don't need to read the image to provide `Latitude` and `Longitude`.
    - [X] Find a way to use the prompt with a constant `radius`.
- [X] Understand the data first (at least read it and look with your own eyes!).
- [X] Learn more about Geospatial data handling, GIS, and Coordinate Reference Systems (CRS).
- [X] Write a `dumb`/`first version` pipeline (_time_ is more important than _optimization_) for now.
- [ ] Add tests.
- [ ] Add the `click` library to run `main.py` in a more convenient way and play with `latitude` and `longitude` in the terminal.
- [X] Document the process.
- [ ] Write draft slides.
- [X] Optimize the process.
    - [X] Check for potential optimization methods for input images. Can I avoid reading the whole image?
- [X] Update documentation.
- [X] Perform performance analysis (Partially achieved).
- [X] Submit.

### üöÄ Main Goal:
Retrieve and return an `image` from the data for the provided `latitude` and `longitude`.

#### Input Data
- A sample of the [provided dataset](https://drive.usercontent.google.com/download?id=140PpLsdnVOQVIp5ia9jT_yvqtcWtF8Gj&export=download&confirm=t&uuid=483b1776-4e25-4976-9837-b498c823754a) was given. 
- One image covers a 1x1 km area.
- The real dataset could be much larger than the provided one.
- There is information that one filename `...X_Y...` contains latitude and longitude ranges from `X/Y` to `X/Y+1000`. I need to extract this data.
- The `radius` parameter can range from `1` to `100` meters.

## Installation

Follow the steps below to set up the project:

0. **Prerequisites**  
    Ensure you have the following installed:
   - `Python` (>=3.8)
   - `Poetry`
1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:BondaiKa/geospatial_data_processing.git
   cd geospatial_data_processing
   ```
2. **Set up the Virtual Environment**  
    Configure Poetry to create a virtual environment in the project folder and install dependencies:
    ```bash
    poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true
    poetry install --no-root
    poetry self add poetry-plugin-shell
    ```
3. **Download and Unzip the Dataset**  
    -	Download the dataset manually from the appropriate source.
	-	Save it in your preferred location.
	-	Update the DATASET_DIRECTORY_ROOT_PATH variable in the notebooks or main.py to point to your dataset.

4. **Run the Project**  
    Activate the virtual environment and run the main script:
    ```bash
    poetry shell
    poetry run python main.py
    ```

## Developing / Technical documentation

To contribute to this project, set up `pre-commit` as follows:
1. Activate the virtual environment:
    ```bash
    poetry shell
    ```
2. Install pre-commit hooks:
    ```bash
    pre-commit install
    ```

### Name Conventions in the Project.

`Latitude`, `Longitude` are preferable to use as variables in this project. 

Prefer `Projcted CRS` to `Geographic CRS`.
- `Latitude`/`X`/ `Easting` are always come first in coordinates pair.
- `Longitude`/`Y`/ `Northing` are always come second in coordinates pair.

In case of boxes there is next order convention (Latitude comes first, Longitude second here as well):
- Latitude Left (Min X), Longitude Bottom (Min Y), Latitude Right (Max X), Latitude Top (Max Y)

## My Developing Journal

Once I read requirements, I have next thoughts in my mind:
##### üëÄ Observation ‚Ññ1
> ‚ö†Ô∏è It was mentioned that the dataset's size could be even bigger, so candidate (I) should consider the case that whole data can't fit in memory.  **Restriction ‚Ññ1**: Don't put whole dataset into memory use iterator, batch, micro-batch processing whatever.

##### üëÄ Observation ‚Ññ2
> `Latitude` and `Longitude` are written in filename already - so for that you don't even need to read image for that.

##### üëÄ Observation ‚Ññ3
>  _Imagine that the images were being retrieved over network on the fly. We encourage you to come up with ways to preprocess the data to optimize the retrieval process._ So they ask you to think about the way to optimize incomming images (maybe it's not needed, but I need to check).

##### üëÄ Observation ‚Ññ4
>  _Consider that while the radius parameter remains generally fixed, the latitude and longitude parameters will vary randomly across requests._ For I don't understand their promt about constant `radious`. For now (11.01.2024) I don't have any idea how to use it in optimization... Caching? One degree left or right - and it's different image, you need to change input 1x1 km into super small images (e.g. 1x1 meter). Then yes,it's possible to cache and use old computation.

#### ‚ùóÔ∏è Challenge that I need to solve (it's not optional)
- Users will type `latitude` and `longitude` and `radious`. One image has `1x1 km` area. It's possible, that user set almost the edge of one image. In that case, I need to retrieve nearest required images (in worst case scenario additional `3` images), that covers radious and return final 256x256 image.
- Handle all posssible errors.

#### ‚ùóÔ∏è Challenge that I need to solve (optional)
- Optimize time execution of `get_image(lat, long, radius)` function with any possible way.
